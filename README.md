# merge-gpx
Tools for merging GPX files. mergeGpx.ts takes 2 files as input, the beginning route and the end route, and tries to find a point in beginning route that is close to the first point in end route. This may be useful, for instance, for prepending a prior route (beginning) to a partially recorded route (end).
